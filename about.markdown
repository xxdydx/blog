Hello! I am Arul, a student. I guess I love computers? I recently ventured into Cybersecurity and CTFs in March 2021, and I'm still learning. Outside of CTFs, I have dabbled in some small web development and machine learning projects before. I'd like to use this platform to document my CTF experience and talk about other random weird stuff too (coming soon!).


Feel free to contact me at [official(at)arul(dot)me](mailto:official@arul.me) for a chat or a cup of coffee.
