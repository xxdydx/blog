Hello! I am Arul, a student from Singapore. I love eating, sleeping and tinkering with computers. I recently ventured into Cybersecurity and CTFs in March 2021, and I'm still learning, I guess. I'd like to use this platform to document my CTF experience.


Outside of CTFs, I have dabbled in some small web development and machine learning projects before. I also have a keen interest in Economics and Politics, and I love reading about current affairs. 


Hit me up at [official(at)arul(dot)me](mailto:official@arul.me) for a chat or a cup of coffee.
