Hello! I am Arul, a student from Singapore. I love eating, sleeping and tinkering with computers. I recently ventured into Cybersecurity and CTFs in March 2021, and I'm still learning, I guess. I'd like to use this platform to document my CTF experience.
Hit me up at [official(at)arul(dot)me](mailto:official@arul.me) for a chat or a cup of coffee.
