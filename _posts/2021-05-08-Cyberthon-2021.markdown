Congratulations to everyone who participated for making it thus far, I'm sure the CTF was fun for most of y'all. 
This was not my best performance in a CTF, since it was only a 7 hour CTF. However, I have still learnt a great deal from this experience, having learnt many new tips and tricks from the training challenges and during the actual CTF itself.
